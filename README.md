# openZole

A protocol for conducting and logging a play of [game _zolÄ«te_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zole).

The [example page](https://janise.github.io/openZole/example.html) demonstrates random selection robots playing 5 round, or allows you to join the game if you so desire. See browser's console for more game info and full log.

An UI adapter is included for a visual representation by [Einar Egilsson's "cards.js" library](https://github.com/einaregilsson/cards.js).</p>

The project is in a demo stage, still a lot more to do.

Using Node.js version 6.10.2.
